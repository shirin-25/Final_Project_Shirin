Business problem : Predict the number of public Wi-Fi hotspots (stations)  that are used each day in Paris.
To conclude: 
Descriptive stats insights about hotspots :
Min = 13 ; Max = 242 ; Average = 165 ; Quartile 25% = 142
=> We found out that the dates where values are below the 25% quartile are mostly on Sundays 

Business insight : deactivate 50 Wi-Fi hotspots on Sundays to reduce unnecessary 
Wi-Fi waves in Paris (reduction of unnecessary pollution)
